## 🔗 API Used

This project uses the [Reqres API](https://reqres.in/) to fetch user data.

## 📌 Assumptions & Considerations

- The user list is fetched from Reqres API.
- Token-based authentication is simulated using localStorage.
- No backend is implemented; all API interactions are frontend-based.
- Error Handling: Basic validation and error messages are included.
- The UI is mobile-responsive for devices like tablets and phones (max-width: 768px and max-width: 480px).
- Styling is done using CSS with a modern and clean layout.
- Users can search by first_name, last_name, email and the search is case-insensitive and updates results dynamically.
